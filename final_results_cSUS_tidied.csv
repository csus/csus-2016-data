The ability to file read codes as problems and as summary items causes a great deal of confusion to new users, they need to choose one or the other as many docs will file under one or the other, but rarely both.

The interface is cluttered and inconsistent. No value appears to have been placed on the value of good interface design or user experience, they need to hire a good UX designer (several!)

The document scanning and workflow interface is very old fashioned, ensuring documents are filed correctly takes an age to set up. Trying to find the document you are looking for takes a long time, there is no search function, there are no document thumbnails. 

There is a great deal of replication of data entry. Medications can be both linked to a problem and filed under it - choose one or the other, but not both.

You have to enter the same information more than once into various different documents, and you cannot look at two different documents at once to do so. This means you either have to print the document out, thereby wasting paper, or continually go in and out of the documents, thereby wasting time, or open Paris twice so you can view the documents next to each other, thereby potentially preventing other users from logging in.   

Would be useful to be able to view current medication in a specific medication tab.  Currently you have to trawl through letters, activities and casenotes (including paper notes).

When it comes to sharing information, Paris is a risk!!

Would be helpful to have online reminders when CPAs, risk assessments, etc are due.

It takes an age just to enter one activity because of all the fields that need to be completed.  Some fields will always be the same, so it would be helpful if they were set as defaults for each user, eg if working in community all entries will be for community.

Information that is entered should be pulled through into every document that requires it instead of having to re-enter it manually.  In CPA care plan it asks for contact information for service user and GP which is already on Paris however we have to go into central index and write this down and then reinput it onto care plan when it is already there.

Please give us a user friendly, intuitive package designed for healthcare, rather than a convoluted one that even the most proficient IT geek struggles with!!

","Far too complicated. Needs major pruning.
Too many key presses / clicks - needs streamlining.

Check boxes may be the future for physicians assitance or ENPs perhaps, or possibly even single speciality clinics, but most unselected , unscheduled patients are not appropriate for this approach.

Just a few free text boxes with at most a few headings. Something familiar to medical training perhaps:
1 History and exam
2 Differntial / problem list,
3 Investigations(which automtaically populates with something useful like RESULTS!),
4 Treatment / Plan.

The last 3 sections should automatically appear on the GP letter.

The prescribing module is obscure and makes the simplest task a major undertaking. Needs major efficiency improvement.

Change the mid-atlantic jargon to something more akin to Emglish (transports, referrals, consultations, transfers ????)

Hardwire the ""advice"" check box automatically into the system, since there is no choice about it.

Stop having to put your password in again to rpint something - you are already logged in!

""My rooms"" and ""my patients"" screens - should default to time order, like the main screen.

Any mandatory clikc box should be VISIBLE without having to scroll down.

Intelligent scroll down text boxes would be nice (so I don;t have to stop typing to move to scroll bar to scroll down to see what I am typing!)

Having notes filed under different referrals also makes it difficult (and long-winded) to find notes.

I would go back to what we had with RiO with bed states. It was easy on RiO to swap beds and admit patients into beds. On CareNotes you have to change ward stays and putting people on leave is even more difficult. Also there is no physical bed or pictures on CareNotes.
There is no way for the CareNotes and application support team to put in pictures on CareNotes. This is really annoying as we have to do wound recording charts on a ready made template document and then upload this into the tissue viability risk assessment tool.
Care plans are awful and unuser friendly - the care plans on RiO were much easier to read and understand. You cannot print off care plans as one large document to go through with patients. It is not patient friendly! 
The system has changed since having the training, which has caused massive anxiety across inpatient teams.
The system appears to work well for community staff but is very difficult and clunky to manage as an inpatient nurse.

1 Can't access full notes on client from their diary entry: have to remember their name and then go back to search for them. This seems counterintuitive and is frustrating.

2 Front page on log in has irrelevant information: eg a specialist outpatient nurse gets ""Named Nurse On My Ward(s)""; it would be so useful if we could customise the front page to provide relevant information

3 Sidebar: Similarly, many of the searches on the sidebar are irrelevant, it would be a much more productive use of space if this could be (a) customisable and (b) you had the ability to hide the sidebar and maximise the working space

4 Lack of rich text on diary entry - can't use semantic architecture to structure information meaningfully - have to use asterisks for emphasis. 

5 Adding a new document on diary entry / clinical note takes you back to diary, rather than back to the client, thus adding lots of extra loops to a routine work flow.

6 Lack of ability to open uploaded documents within Carenotes (rather than having to open in Word or Acrobat) is clumsy and frustrating

7 It would be useful to have a wide series of templates to generate documents from (eg word letter document pre-populated with GP name and address, client details, Team heading etc)

8 Can't filter notes by clinician/team - very difficult if there are many contacts, eg has been IP recently; 
Can't easily call up notes  >3 months ago; an 'all time' function as well as relevant filters would make sense, and prevent essential information being missed that contributes to safety and effectiveness of care

8 Full screen that tells you you've saved a document - serves no purpose, is an extra click, interrupts work flow

9 Clinical note doesnt register as productive work unless its a diary entry

It would be much better to use EPR for note taking (for example as used at Kings College Hospital NHS Trust) as this makes linking to results and patient documents much easier, seems to crash less often, allows you to pull up patients notes as a single pdf document which is easy to read and scan through.

However I would only like this IF people used the system as intended- please see below comments.,"The system is good for patient care if it is used as intended. However notes can not be read easily by all members of staff and therefore professionals (especially doctors) are not reading entries that would support their management of the patient (such as discharge destination/care needed/support on discharge etc). 

There has been many times that doctors/nurses just do not look at a therapies entry and then spend unjust time asking/bleeping the therapist for undates that have clearly been entered onto the system.

It takes too long to open it and therefore less time spent with patients.

There are not enough computers to go around the staff therefore you spend time hunting for a computer, logining in, finding the information you need and so all time wasted which was a 1 minute job on paper.

Observations are not entered in a timely manner by the nurses to the system; therefore you go to see a patient at 13:00 and then last observation available to see is at 09:00.

Certain areas of therapy need specific information that is better completed in a form format; this is readily available on our established EPR system but has not been fully populated into e-noting. Therefore the system is entirely unfit for purpose and was rolled out with no hope of working in specific areas. This is the same not just for therapies but in nursing and medical areas as well who used EPR before.

I also have no idea why we use this system as King's has EPR in note format and as most members of staff use EPR at Guy's this in my mind would be a more logical step.

My staff also need training in yet another system which places more strain on an already stretched service; if you are asking what I would change it would be that we, as a trust, strategically look long and hard at all these systems and try to consolidate where we can, as clinically, it is an ever increasing burden.",,,

If you don't notice that another record has been added the questionnaires end up on the supervision record not on the patient appointment record. 
You can't delete these records or change the date of the appointment once they have been entered.
The patient search facility is not brilliant i.e. if you enter the exact name of the patient it if likely to list other patients with different names higher than the patient with the name entered even if there is only one patient on the system with that name.
IF you sort the patient list by name, date, or ID it resorts them by stage and surname every time you go into a different tab.",,,

the diary function to the left upper side of the screen which contains client details, when I hover over the clients name it would be helpful if I could see the clients first name.

keeping up to date with adding diagnoses can be arkward, it would be helpful to have a panel on the left that allowed me to see which of my current clients and previous clients have not had a diagnoses and/or medication completed on their profile.

The fact that battles happen over who will complete the core and risk assessment is not an indication of lazy staff but frustrations with the system in that it is wxecssively time consuming to enter info and knowing that colleagues will struggle to get the info out doesn't help.  I think it is a system that introduces clinical risks rather than help dissipate it.  And don't get me started on the search function - essentially you don't need it coz you can only search in such restricted manners that you need to know what you are looking for.  Lastly, when the system is so inflexible that you have to learn how to enter simple things like diagnosis in a very particular way and be restricted to not being able to say someone is without a diagnosis, it doesn't help understanding the epidemiology of population served.

When you enter a questionnaire it would be easier if it automatically attached it to the contact you were completing, instead of having to choose an option (this can get confusing if there is more than one for today's date). It would be mouch more helpful if the list of names at the side highlighted any incomplete contacts and how many sessions they had attended; how many DNAs etc. That client list doesn't separate those on your caseload in treatment from those that are on other waiting lists (and therefore not requiring any action from you anymore). All notes would be kept on the same page so you can just scroll down and read everything (important if looking for risk information), instead of having to go in and out of each contact. Also supervision notes would be better places underneath clinical session notes, just so all notes are together and the nothing is missed. If you don't know where to look then notes can be missed. If you want to add a note to say that you have tried calling someone or sent an email etc. then you have to complete a cliniacl contact (timely; unnecessary) or you can add a non-clinical note but that would be missed by other clinicians.
